The writer of this poem was Rabindranath Tagore (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941), a Bengali poet, novelist, musician, painter and playwright who reshaped Bengali literature and music.  
He was the first non-European to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature (1913). 
I confess that I had never heard of this poem – or even of Tagore – until I was introduced to it recently by a dear Chinese friend.
