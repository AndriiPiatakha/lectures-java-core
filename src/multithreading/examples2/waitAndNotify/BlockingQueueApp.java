/**
 * Source:
 * <em>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2536692/a-simple-scenario-using-wait-and-notify-in-java</em>
 * <br><br>
 * Firstly, you need to ensure that any calls to {@code wait() or notify()} are
 * within a synchronized region of code (with the {@code wait() or notify()}
 * calls being synchronized on the "same" object).
 * The reason for this (other than the standard thread safety concerns) is
 * due to something known as a missed signal.
 * <br><br>
 * An example of this, is that a thread may call {@link WaitAndNotify_8.BlockingQueue#put}
 * when the queue happens to be full, it then checks the condition, sees that
 * the queue is full, however
 * before it can block another thread is scheduled. This second thread then
 * {@link WaitAndNotify_8.BlockingQueue#take()}'s an element from the queue,
 * and notifies the waiting threads that the
 * queue is no longer full. Because the first thread has already checked the
 * condition. However, it will simply call {@code wait()} after being
 * re-scheduled, even though it could make progress.
 * <br>
 * By synchronizing on a shared object, you can ensure that this problem does
 * not occur,as the second thread's {@link WaitAndNotify_8.BlockingQueue#take()}
 * call will not be able to make progress until the first thread has actually
 * blocked.
 * <br>
 * You must hold the lock (synchronized) before invoking wait/notify. Threads
 * also have to acquire lock before waking.
 * <br><br>
 * More: In order to wait on an object, we must be synchronized on that object.
 * <br>
 * But our thread will automatically release the lock temporarily while waiting.
 * Calling {@code wait()} means that our thread will be suspended until it is
 * "notified". Our thread will be "notified", and thus woken up, when another
 * thread calls {@code notify()} on the object that we're waiting on (in this
 * case, the connection list).
 * When our thread wakes up, it automatically regains the
 * lock. We can now check again that the list is not empty, and if it isn't,
 * safely take out the first connection. This checking and removing will be
 * atomic because we have the lock on the list.
