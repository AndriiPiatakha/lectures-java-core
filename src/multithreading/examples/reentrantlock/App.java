/**
 * the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} class in Java as an
 * alternative to synchronized code blocks.
 * <br>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}s let you do all the
 * stuff that you can do with {@code synchronized}, {@link Object#wait()} and
 * {@link Object#notify()}, plus some more stuff. Besides that may come in
 * handy from time to time.
 * <br><br>
 * Source:<em>
 * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html
 * </em>
 * <br><br>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} Extended capabilities
 * include:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The ability to have more than one {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition}
 * variable per monitor.
 * </li>
 * <li>Monitors that use the synchronized keyword can only have one. This means
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}s support more than one
 * {@link Object#wait()}/{@link Object#notify()} queue.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The ability to make the lock "fair".
 * <em>
 * "[fair] locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread. Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular access order."
 * </em>
 * </li>
 * <li>Synchronized blocks are unfair.</li>
 * <li>The ability to check if the lock is being
 * held.</li>
 * <li>The ability to get the list of threads waiting on the lock.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * The disadvantages of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}s are:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Need to add import statement.</li>
 * <li>Need to wrap lock acquisitions in a try/finally block. This makes it more
 * ugly than the synchronized keyword.</li>
 * <li>The synchronized keyword can be put in method definitions which avoids
 * the need for a block which reduces nesting.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br><br>
 * For more complete comparison of
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}s and {@code synchronized}
