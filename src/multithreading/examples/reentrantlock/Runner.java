 * Source:<em>

 * <p>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}:
 * This is the base interface for Lock API. It provides all the features
 * of synchronized keyword with additional ways to create different Conditions
 * for locking, providing timeout for thread to wait for lock. Some of the
 * important methods are {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock#lock()} to
 * acquire the lock, {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock#unlock()} to release
 * the lock, {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock#tryLock()} to wait for lock
 * for a certain period of time,
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock#newCondition()}
 * to create the Condition etc.
 * <p>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}:
 * This is the most widely used implementation class of Lock
 * interface. This class implements the Lock interface in similar way as
 * synchronized keyword. (see App.java for more)
 * <p>
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition}:
 * Condition objects are similar to Object wait-notify model with
 * additional feature to create different sets of wait. A Condition object is
 * always created by Lock object. Some of the important methods are
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#await()}
 * that is similar to {@link Object#wait()}.
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signal()} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signalAll()}
 * that are similar to
 * {@link Object#notify()} and {@link Object#notifyAll()} methods.
