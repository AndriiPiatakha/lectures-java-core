        limit connections to 10
        true means whichever thread gets first in the waiting pool (queue)
        waiting to acquire a resource, is first to obtain the permit.

        Note that I called it a pool!
        The reason is when you say "Queue", you're saying that things are
        scheduled to be FIFO (First In First Out) .. which is not always the case
        here!
        When you initialize the semaphore with Fairness, by setting its second
        argument to true, it will treat the waiting threads like FIFO.
        But,
        it doesn't have to be that way if you don't set on the fairness. the JVM
        may schedule the waiting threads in some other manner that it sees best
        (See the Java specifications for that).
